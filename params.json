{"name":"TheSpawn.net Rules & Guidelines","tagline":"Just a document giving a brief history of TheSpawn.net, including rules/guidelines and services available.","body":"# TheSpawn.net Rules & Guidelines\r\n\r\n## What is TheSpawn.net?\r\n\r\nTheSpawn.net was originally conceived as a gathering place for any/all gamers to meet and interact with gamers from other more game/server-specific \"sub”-communities. We began as a few friends who had met through the Minecraft community, but we were all \"part” of different server-specific communities (i.e. Discovr, Minecrap, etc.) and we wanted a place where we could all hang out which wasn’t specifically for people in our respective servers. We initially created an IRC channel simply to have a place where we could congregate and meet people from other parts of the general gaming community. Once we did that, we started to see potential for TheSpawn.net to become more than just an IRC channel where people could talk, and we started having gaming events now and then. When we started to quickly grow, we decided it would be nice to have the ability to voice-chat with other people in TheSpawn, so we also set up a mumble server, and a website linking to our IRC channel and mumble server addresses.\r\n  \r\n> Since its inception, TheSpawn.net has become a community all its own, without any real push from any of us to become anything other than what it has naturally evolved into. We are very glad that other people feel about TheSpawn the way we do, and continue to make it the amazing place it is.\r\n\r\n**_To join our IRC channel or mumble server, visit our web \"portal”: [TheSpawn.net](http://thespawn.net)_**\r\n\r\n\r\n## IRC Info\r\n\r\nTheSpawn.net hosts an IRC channel, **#spawn**, on the [QuakeNet](http://quakenet.org) server.\r\n\r\nIf you haven’t been there and are unsure how to access it, use one of the following two methods to connect:\r\n\r\n1. Use the browser-based webchat client located [here](http://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=spawn)\r\n2. Download and install an IRC client onto your comuter such as [mIRC](http://mirc.com) (Windows) or [Xchat](http://xchat.org/) (multi-platform) and connect to the server `irc.quakenet.org`, using the default IRC port number `6667`. Once connected, issue the command `/join #spawn`.\r\n\r\n## Rules / Guidelines\r\n\r\n* Do not use overtly offensive language. (_self-explanatory_)\r\n\r\n* Please try to keep CAPS to a minimum. (_If you use excessive caps, you will be warned, and subsequent usages will be met with either a kick or a ban from the channel._)\r\n\r\n* Respect others. (_self-explanatory_)\r\n\r\n* If nobody responds to you right away, please don’t keep rambling on and on to yourself, filling up the chat with useless chatter. Most of the users in #spawn idle there 24/7 and aren’t always at the computer to respond. If it seems quiet, just be patient and don’t pester other users when they aren’t talking.\r\n\r\n* Nobody likes spam. If you have a server/website you’d like to advertise in the channel, please don’t just come in, paste the link, and leave, or something similar. Stick around and get to know people before you do something like that, as we’re far more likely to trust your opinion on something if we know something about you beforehand.\r\n\r\n## Services\r\n\r\n> **Herobrine** - Herobrine is TheSpawn's own instance of [SpawnBot](https://github.com/xwcg/SpawnBot), an IRC bot created by [xwcg](http://github.com/xwcg) to offer us in **#spawn** various services.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n* If someone posts a youtube video link in the chatroom, Herobrine will pull the video title from youtube and speak it in the channel, so we all know what the link points to and can then choose to watch it or not. Similarly, if someone posts a direct link to a tweet they've posted on twitter, Herobrine will parse it and post the contents of said tweet directly in the chatroom.\r\n\r\n* If you type `!lp list`, Herobrine will respond with a list of known LP’ers in TheSpawn Community, and you can then use `!lp <name>` to get more info or a link to said user’s youtube channel.\r\n\r\nVarious other commands exist (_all commands prefixed with an exclamation point \"!\"_):\r\n\r\n**Game sales**\r\n \r\n* `!sale`\r\n* `!game|gameprice [gamename]`\r\n* `!poor`\r\n* `!steam`\r\n* `!gog`\r\n* `!gmg`\r\n* `!gg`\r\n \r\n**Randomizers**\r\n \r\n* `!roll [dice OR number]`\r\n* `!flip|coin`\r\n* `!choose [option 1];[option 2];etc...`\r\n \r\n**Profanity safe insulting**\r\n \r\n* `!insult [name]`\r\n \r\n**Quake Live**\r\n \r\n* `!ql`\r\n* `!ql signup`\r\n* `!ql remove`\r\n \r\n**TheSpawn.net Specific**\r\n \r\n* `!server`\r\n* `!mumble`\r\n* `!uhc`\r\n \r\n**Software**\r\n \r\n* `!version`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
